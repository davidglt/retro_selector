# Retro Selector

GitHub: [davidglt/retro_selector](https://github.com/davidglt/retro_selector).

Desktop browser for MAME ROM/sample ZIPs, SNES ROM files and Sega Mega Drive / Genesis ROM files, with remote file management, built with Python, Tkinter, Pillow, and AsyncSSH.

Browse local MAME ZIPs or supported SNES ROM files, transfer selected files over SCP, and list or delete matching remote files over SSH. Switch between MAME (ROMs/Samples), SNES and Sega Mega Drive / Genesis (`megadrive`) profiles in the same application: all functionality remains in `retro_selector.py`, with no second Python program.

## Project status

The MAME/SNES profile update has not been runtime tested. The graphical interface and live device compatibility have not been verified. Test with expendable files before using remote deletion on your collection.

## Example setup

This is the author's example setup, not tested compatibility or a guarantee for any other device or version:

- an iPad 2 running iOS 6.1.3 with a jailbreak, reachable over SSH;
- an iCade controller;
- the MAME profile, with local ROMs in `roms_mame/` by default and your existing configured remote MAME ROM destination (preserved as is; this documentation does not assume a value);
- the SNES profile, with local ROMs in `roms_snes/` by default and the remote destination `/var/mobile/Media/ROMs/Snes9xEX/roms/`;
- the Sega Mega Drive / Genesis profile, with local ROMs in `roms_md/` by default and the proposed, editable remote destination `/var/mobile/Media/ROMs/MD.emu/roms/` (a suggestion for an old MD.emu build; it is not known to exist on your device, so check it);
- samples exist only for MAME.

The desktop application browses and transfers ROMs and offers SSH terminal access. It does not install emulators, jailbreak devices or configure the iCade. Emulator versions, jailbreak method, controller mappings and server details are outside its scope; enter your own host and credentials in the interface. The example properties file keeps credentials empty.

## Requirements

- Python with Tkinter.
- Dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`: Pillow, AsyncSSH and pyte (terminal emulation).
- A reachable SSH server and valid credentials.
- Existing local source and remote destination directories for the selected mode.
- SCP support for copying; SFTP or a compatible POSIX shell for listing and deletion.

The included launcher is intended for Windows CMD.

## Installation

Place the application files in your collection's parent directory. For the example setup:

```text
D:\Ipad2\
├── retro_selector.py
├── retro_selector.cmd
├── requirements.txt
├── README.md
├── LICENSE
├── retro_selector.properties.example
├── roms_mame\

├── roms_md\
│   └── example.md
├── roms_snes\
│   └── example.sfc
└── samples_mame\
    └── example.zip
```

From Windows CMD:

```cmd
cd /d D:\Ipad2
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
retro_selector.cmd
```

The launcher uses `.venv\Scripts\python.exe` when available, otherwise `python` from `PATH`. It does not require manual virtual-environment activation.

Alternatively, run directly:

```cmd
.venv\Scripts\python.exe retro_selector.py
```

## Quick start

1. Run `retro_selector.cmd`.
2. Choose `mame`, `snes` or `megadrive` in `Emulator` (and `roms` or `samples` in `MAME content` for MAME).
3. Check the matching local source and click `Load` if you have edited its path.
4. Enter the SSH host, port, username, and credentials; check the matching remote destination.
5. Select the remote listing mode and enable legacy RSA only if required.
6. Click `Refresh` in the right panel (the remote list also loads automatically when you switch emulator or MAME content; see below).
7. Verify any new server fingerprint through a trusted channel before accepting it.
8. Mark local files supported by the selected profile and click `Copy selected`.
9. Review the selected profile (and MAME content mode, when applicable), destination, and complete batch list before confirming.
10. Click `Save` if you want to preserve the configuration and selected profile settings.

For the first deletion test, use remote files for the selected profile which you can safely recreate.

## Emulator profiles (MAME / SNES / Sega Mega Drive / Genesis)

The readonly `Emulator` selector chooses the active profile. SSH host, port, user, credentials, listing mode and the SSH terminal are shared by both profiles; local sources and remote destinations are separate.

| UI field | Configuration key | Default | Profile |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `MAME ROM source` | `rom.source` | `roms_mame/` | MAME |
| `MAME samples source` | `samples.source` | `samples_mame/` | MAME |
| `SNES ROM source` | `snes.rom.source` | `roms_snes/` | SNES |
| `Mega Drive ROM source` | `megadrive.rom.source` | `roms_md/` | Sega Mega Drive / Genesis |
| `Remote MAME ROMs` | `ssh.remote_dir` | `/var/mobile/Media/ROMs/MAME4iOS/roms/` | MAME |
| `Remote MAME samples` | `samples.remote_dir` | `/var/mobile/Media/ROMs/MAME4iOS/samples/` | MAME |
| `Remote SNES ROMs` | `snes.remote_dir` | `/var/mobile/Media/ROMs/Snes9xEX/roms/` | SNES |
| `Remote Mega Drive ROMs` | `megadrive.remote_dir` | `/var/mobile/Media/ROMs/MD.emu/roms/` (proposal, editable) | Sega Mega Drive / Genesis |

The configuration area has two columns. The left column holds the shared SSH settings (host, port, user, authentication, password or key, legacy RSA and credential-saving options, listing mode, terminal scrollback lines). The right column always shows `Emulator` at the top. `MAME content` appears immediately below it only when `Emulator` is `mame`. Two grid rows below the selectors are reused for the active paths and show only the fields of the selected content: MAME + `roms` shows `Local MAME ROMs` (with its `Browse...` button) and `Remote MAME ROMs`; MAME + `samples` shows `Local MAME samples` (with its `Browse...` button) and `Remote MAME samples`; SNES shows `Local SNES ROMs` (with its `Browse...` button) and `Remote SNES ROMs`, Sega Mega Drive / Genesis shows `Local Mega Drive ROMs` (with its `Browse...` button) and `Remote Mega Drive ROMs`; in both cases `MAME content` and every MAME path field and button are hidden. Hidden paths are never reset or overwritten, and `Save` persists both emulator profiles and both MAME path pairs even when hidden. A bottom row holds `Load`, `Save` and `>_ SSH terminal`.

The active profile is stored in `emulator.active` (`mame`, `snes` or `megadrive`). Editing one path never changes another. Use the `Browse...` buttons to change local paths; browsing the active source loads it, browsing another only updates its setting.

### MAME: ROMs and Samples

In the MAME profile the readonly `MAME content` selector (`content.mode`, `roms` or `samples`) chooses between the ROM and sample collections. Samples (local and remote) belong exclusively to MAME. Only the local and remote directory fields of the selected content are visible: ROMs mode hides all samples fields and buttons, Samples mode hides the MAME ROM fields and buttons, and SNES hides `MAME content` and all MAME path fields and buttons. Their saved values are preserved and reappear when you switch back to MAME.

### SNES

The SNES profile browses and transfers files with these extensions (case-insensitive): `.sfc`, `.smc`, `.swc`, `.fig` and `.zip`. This is the list the application filters on; it does not check that the emulator or any device accepts a particular file. Files are copied and deleted as they are, with no conversion, header removal, renaming or unzipping. No MAME sample matching or MAME-specific messages (BIOS/parent warnings) are applied. Local files are shown by full filename; covers are optional: an optional PNG with the same stem (`game.png` for `game.sfc`) is used as a thumbnail when present and readable.

### Sega Mega Drive / Genesis

The profile is labelled `Sega Mega Drive / Genesis` and stored as `megadrive`. It targets plain cartridge ROMs for an old MD.emu build on an iPad 2 with iOS 6.1.3 and Sega CD disabled. It lists and transfers files with these extensions (case-insensitive): `.bin`, `.md`, `.gen`, `.smd` and `.zip`. Save files and other companions (for example `.srm`, `.sav`, state files) are not ROM extensions and are never listed, copied or deleted by this profile. Sega CD, 32X, MD+ and MSU-MD content is not offered or supported by this option. No MAME validations, BIOS, parent or sample checks are applied; files are transferred as they are, without conversion or unzipping. Covers work as in SNES (`game.png` next to `game.md`), otherwise a cartridge placeholder is shown. The extension filter does not guarantee that the emulator accepts a file. The remote directory is only a proposal: edit it to the real location on your device; the application does not create it.

Historical notes on how the author built MD.emu 1.4.17D on the iPad 2 itself are in [docs/mdemu-1.4.17D-build-history.md](docs/mdemu-1.4.17D-build-history.md).

Not verified: operation on a real iPad 2 / iOS 6.1.3 / MD.emu (directory layout, SCP/SFTP behaviour, ROM loading). The automated tests (see [Automated tests](#automated-tests)) do not cover any of this.

### Switching profiles

Changing `Emulator` (or `MAME content`) clears local and remote marks, resets the search filters and pagination, invalidates the previous remote list, and loads the selected profile's local source. The new profile's remote directory is then listed automatically (see [Remote listing](#remote-listing)). A listing from one profile cannot authorize deletion in another, and destinations are never mixed.

Switching is blocked while an operation, batch confirmation or the SSH terminal is active. Copy, list and delete operations capture the profile, local source, remote destination and selection before asynchronous work starts; later changes in the interface do not affect a running operation. Copy and deletion confirmations show the profile and destination.

If the selected source does not exist, the application reports an error and leaves the local panel empty. Local and remote directories are not created automatically.

### Existing configuration files

Existing `rom.source`, `ssh.remote_dir`, `samples.source`, `samples.remote_dir` and `content.mode` settings stay MAME settings and are not replaced by SNES values. Missing keys use defaults, including `emulator.active=mame`, `snes.rom.source=roms_snes/`, `snes.remote_dir=/var/mobile/Media/ROMs/Snes9xEX/roms/`, `megadrive.rom.source=roms_md/`, `megadrive.remote_dir=/var/mobile/Media/ROMs/MD.emu/roms/` and `terminal.scrollback_lines=10000`. For MAME ROMs, a missing `rom.source` resolves to the previous `roms/` value when the configuration contains at least one recognized setting but contains none of `rom.source`, `emulator.active` or any `snes.*` or `megadrive.*` setting. Otherwise it resolves to `roms_mame/`, including when no recognized settings are loaded (no file, or an empty, comment-only or unrecognized-only file). An explicitly configured `rom.source` is kept unchanged.

The default local MAME samples folder is now `samples_mame/` (previously `samples/`). An explicitly configured `samples.source` is preserved unchanged; only new or missing values use the new default. The application never renames, moves or deletes your files: either rename your existing local `samples/` folder to `samples_mame/` yourself, or set `MAME samples source` to the existing folder. `samples.remote_dir` is unchanged.

Clicking `Save` writes all settings (both profiles and the active emulator). Internal operation snapshots are not written. The example file has empty credentials; you do not need to replace your local configuration with it.

## Local collections

Relative local sources are resolved against the directory containing `retro_selector.py`, not the current CMD working directory. Absolute source paths are also supported. Relative private-key paths use the same base directory.

Place optional PNG thumbnails beside their corresponding ROM files, with the same filename stem:

```text
roms_mame/
├── galaxian.zip
├── galaxian.png
├── galaga.zip
└── galaga.png
```

Only files with the profile's extensions (`.zip` for MAME; see SNES and Sega Mega Drive / Genesis above) directly inside the active source are scanned; subdirectories are not scanned. Missing or unreadable PNGs never cause errors; an actual cover always takes precedence, otherwise a built-in placeholder is shown: an SNES controller for SNES, an arcade panel for MAME ROMs, and the musical-note placeholder for MAME samples. Nothing is downloaded or generated. MAME sample ZIPs do not require PNGs. Images remain local and are not copied.

The placeholders are drawn with Pillow from shapes equivalent to the SVG sources in `assets/` (`snes-sin-caratula.svg`, `mame-sin-caratula.svg`); the SVG files are not loaded at runtime and no SVG library is needed.

### Search and multiple selection

- Local search ignores case and matches the filename without its extension.
- An empty search includes all supported local files, displayed in pages of 40.
- Click a thumbnail or its graphical checkbox to mark or unmark a file.
- Marks survive search changes and pagination within the same content mode.
- `Select all matches` includes matching files on every page.
- `Clear marks` clears the entire selection, including hidden marks.
- The counter reports marks outside the current filter.
- Loading a different source or changing content mode clears the previous selection.
- Editing the active source requires clicking `Load` before copying.

### Already on remote indicator

After a valid remote listing, local files whose full name (with extension, case-sensitive as reported by the server) appears in the complete remote list are dimmed and labelled **Already on remote**. This works for MAME ROMs and samples, SNES and Mega Drive. It only means a remote file has the same name: it does not claim identical content, integrity or compatibility.

The indicator is separate from the selection checkbox: nothing is selected or deselected automatically, and files already on the remote can still be selected and copied again (the usual confirmation about overwriting applies). The remote search filter does not affect it. Before the remote list is loaded, or after it is invalidated (profile, content, host, port, user, directory or listing mode change, or a failed listing), no indicator is shown and the panel reports that the remote is not checked. Indicators update after Refresh and the existing refreshes after copying or deleting; no periodic connections are made.

### Batch copying

`Copy selected` displays the selected profile and content mode, complete file list (including marks hidden by the search filter), and destination before transfer.

Files are copied sequentially over one authenticated SSH connection. Existing remote files with the same names may be overwritten. Successful files are unmarked; failed and pending files remain marked for retry.

Per-file errors allow the batch to continue while the connection remains usable. Connection loss or timeout stops the batch. The result window distinguishes completed, failed, and pending files.

Only selected files are copied. MAME ROMs mode does not automatically copy samples; select Samples mode to manage those ZIPs separately. Parent ROMs, BIOS, sample dependencies, CHDs, and emulator compatibility are not checked or resolved.

## Remote listing

The right panel lists files with the active profile's supported extensions in its remote directory (`.zip` for MAME; the SNES extensions are listed above). File presence does not prove that the emulator can use the contents.

Click `Refresh` to load the list. The application does not connect at startup, and there is no persistent auto-connect: nothing contacts the server until you click `Refresh`, copy, delete or open the terminal, or change the emulator or content. After you change `Emulator` or `MAME content`, the list is refreshed automatically, but only if the connection settings are usable (valid host, port, username, absolute remote directory, existing local source directory, an entered password for password authentication or an existing private key for key authentication). Otherwise the status line says the list was not loaded and you can fix the settings and click `Refresh`. Automatic refreshes use the same connection code, so an unknown server still shows the host-key prompt, changed keys are rejected, and failures are shown in the status line instead of a dialog. Editing host, port, username, directory or listing mode does not connect on each keystroke; it only invalidates the list, and you click `Refresh`. There is no periodic polling. Closing the SSH terminal also leaves the list invalidated until you click `Refresh`. Refreshes never overlap, and a result that arrives after the settings, profile or directory changed (or after the list was invalidated) is discarded.

Below the file count, `Disk space` shows the space available to the SSH user, the total size and the percentage free for the filesystem that contains the active remote directory (not an assumed root filesystem), for example `Disk space: 12.3 GiB available of 58.0 GiB (21% free)`. It is measured on the same connection as each listing, so it updates with `Refresh`, with automatic refreshes and after a successful copy or deletion (through the existing post-operation refresh). In `sftp` mode the SFTP filesystem-statistics extension (`statvfs@openssh.com`) is tried first; if the server does not support it, or in `ssh` mode, the read-only command `df -Pk '<directory>'` (directory quoted) is run. If neither works, or the output cannot be parsed, it shows `Disk space: unavailable`; listing and transfers are not affected. It shows `not loaded` before a listing or after the target changes, and `loading...` during a refresh. Values are approximate: they are a snapshot, and quotas, reserved blocks or unusual filesystems may differ from what other tools report. The percentage and sizes use binary units (KiB, MiB, GiB).

Its search works independently of the local search and matches the remote filename. Changing the content mode, host, port, username, either configured remote directory, or listing mode invalidates the old list and clears remote marks.

Choose a listing mode explicitly:

| Mode | Requirements and behavior |
| --- | --- |
| `ssh` | Executes POSIX shell commands over SSH. Intended for Unix-like servers, including the original legacy device. Requires a POSIX shell and `printf` with NUL output support. |
| `sftp` | Uses the remote SFTP subsystem, which must be installed and enabled. |

There is no automatic fallback. Listing failures are reported rather than treated as an empty directory.

In `ssh` mode, filenames beginning with a dot are not listed. The SFTP listing does not have this shell-glob exclusion. Listing can include symbolic links to regular files, but deletion rejects symbolic links.

## Remote selection and deletion

Remote marks use textual checkbox indicators `[ ]` and `[x]` in the `Mark` column, rather than graphical checkbox widgets.

- Click the `Mark` column to toggle a file.
- Press Space to toggle a focused row.
- Clicking the filename alone does not mark the file.
- Marks survive remote search changes within a mode.
- `Select all matches` marks all matching remote filenames.
- `Clear marks` clears all remote marks, including hidden ones.

`Delete selected` displays the content mode, host, username, port, directory, and complete filename list before requesting confirmation. Hidden marks are included.

Deletion is permanent and does not modify local files. It targets exact selected file paths without recursive or wildcard deletion. Directories and symbolic links are rejected. For MAME, BIOS, parent ROMs, and sample dependencies are not detected: removing required ZIPs can affect other games.

Successful deletions are unmarked. Failed or pending files remain marked if they still exist after refreshing. The result window reports individual outcomes, and the remote list refreshes after deletion or successful copying.

A timeout or disconnection can leave an individual outcome uncertain. Check the refreshed list before retrying. Concurrent server-side filesystem changes are not prevented; use a trusted remote directory.

## Progress bar

### Copying

The global bar gives equal weight to each file. Within the current file, it uses that file's transfer percentage. It is not the percentage of all bytes in the batch: a small file and a large file have the same global weight.

### Deletion

The bar advances after each file is processed, whether deletion succeeds or fails. It remains unchanged while waiting for the current operation's response.

A value of 100% means every file was processed, not that every file was deleted. Check the completed, failed, and pending counts. An interrupted batch retains the processed fraction instead of forcing 100%.

## Authentication and configuration

Set the SSH host, port, username, and absolute remote directory for each content mode. Choose `password` or `key` authentication. Connection settings are shared; sources and destinations are separate.

For key authentication, select the local private key, not its `.pub` file. Its corresponding public key must already be authorized on the server. Enter a passphrase if the private key is encrypted.

`Allow legacy SSH RSA (SHA-1)` permits `ssh-rsa` signatures. It does not enable every obsolete cipher or key-exchange algorithm. The initial defaults target the author's legacy device; change them for other servers and disable legacy compatibility when unnecessary.

Click `Save` to write `retro_selector.properties` next to the script. The file loads on startup; missing settings use defaults. Saving does not initiate a transfer.

The parser uses UTF-8 and literal `key=value` lines, splitting at the first equals sign. Windows backslashes do not require escaping. Relative local paths remain relative when saved. Lines beginning with `#` or `!` are comments.

Use `retro_selector.properties.example` as a credential-free template.

### Credential storage

Credentials are not saved by default. Optional saving stores passwords and key passphrases in plain text after confirmation. Anyone who can read the file can read them.

Clearing the option and clicking `Save` erases stored credentials without clearing the current interface values. Do not commit local configuration, private keys, or credentials. The provided `.gitignore` excludes local settings and common private-key filenames.

### Server identity

Verify a new server fingerprint through a trusted channel before accepting it. Approved public keys are stored in `retro_selector_host_keys.json` and pinned on the authenticated connection. Changed keys are rejected.

OpenSSH `known_hosts` is not imported automatically. Do not remove saved keys merely to bypass a warning; first verify whether the server was legitimately reinstalled or its identity changed.

## SSH terminal

Click `>_ SSH terminal` in the Configuration panel to open a separate interactive terminal window on the configured server. It uses the same AsyncSSH connection code as the file operations (no external `ssh` executable), so no second SSH-password prompt appears when valid credentials are already entered. The first connection to an unknown server still shows the explicit host-key trust prompt, and changed server keys are rejected. Remote prompts such as `sudo` or `su` are not suppressed or answered automatically.

- The host, port, user, authentication mode, password, key path, key passphrase, legacy-RSA setting and `Terminal scrollback lines` are copied when the window opens and stay fixed for that session. Changing the scrollback setting afterwards (it is locked while a session is open anyway) affects only the next session.
- Local ROM/sample folders and remote directories are not needed and are not used. No `cd` or any other command is run automatically.
- A real remote PTY is requested with `TERM=vt100`. Screen state is emulated with pyte and drawn in Tkinter: cursor addressing, erase operations, scrolling regions, bold/underline/reverse, basic colors, DEC line-drawing characters, application cursor keys, and device/cursor-position replies. Alternate-screen modes (`?47`, `?1047`, `?1049`) and bracketed paste (`?2004`) are also implemented. The remote PTY size follows the window size.
- Keys: printable characters (character at a time, no local echo), Enter, Backspace (sends DEL), Tab, Shift+Tab, Escape, arrows, Home/End/PageUp/PageDown/Insert/Delete, F1-F12, Alt+key (ESC prefix) and Ctrl+letter and other control characters. Ctrl+C, Ctrl+D, Ctrl+Z and Ctrl+V go to the remote side unchanged.
- Copy and paste: select text with the mouse and use the `Copy` button or Ctrl+Shift+C; paste with the `Paste` button or Ctrl+Shift+V. Pasting several lines asks for confirmation first, because the text may execute remote commands. Control characters (including Escape) are removed from pasted text. Bracketed paste is used only if the remote application enabled it. A redraw of a selected line clears the selection.
- `Disconnect` ends the session; after the session ends the button becomes `Close`. Closing the window also disconnects. The main window cannot be closed while a session is active.
- While a terminal session is active, file operations, `Save` and configuration edits are disabled (this initial implementation serializes them to avoid concurrent host-registry writes). When the session ends the remote listing is invalidated, because console commands may have changed remote files; click `Refresh` to reload it. Local selections are not modified.
- Scrollback: the terminal window has a vertical scrollbar and responds to the mouse wheel (3 lines per notch). Scrolling is purely local; no keys or escape sequences are sent to the remote side. The setting `Terminal scrollback lines` (`terminal.scrollback_lines` in `retro_selector.properties`, default `10000`) is the number of completed lines retained after they scroll off the top of the main screen; the visible rows are not counted and the remote PTY size never includes history or the scrollbar. The value must be a positive base-10 integer (`1`, `250`, `10000`); zero, negative, fractional, empty, malformed values, line breaks and NUL are rejected with an error before `Save` or terminal launch. There is no arbitrary upper limit other than the platform's maximum integer, but memory grows with the number of retained lines, so choose a value your computer can hold (a typical 80-column line needs on the order of a few hundred bytes).
- Following versus reading: at the bottom the view follows new output. After you scroll up, the lines you are reading stay in place while output arrives; when the oldest lines are discarded once the limit is exceeded, the view is clamped to the oldest retained line. Typing a key that is sent to the remote side, or pasting, returns to the live bottom; mouse-wheel, scrollbar, `Copy` and Ctrl+Shift+C do not. The cursor is hidden while browsing history. After the session ends the retained history can still be scrolled and read.
- Alternate-screen applications (`vi`, `vim`, `top`, `less`, using `?47`, `?1047` or `?1049`) are kept separate: their frames are never added to the history, the live screen is always shown, and the scrollbar and wheel are disabled (the wheel does nothing) until the application exits, when the previous screen and history are restored.
- Credentials are never put in process arguments, logs or extra settings files.

Scrollback limitations: only lines that scroll off the whole main screen are retained. Lines pushed out by an application's partial scrolling region (`TERM=vt100` full-screen programs that set a region smaller than the screen), screen redraws, cursor movement, erase and resize are not history, and a terminal cannot distinguish a program that redraws by scrolling the whole screen from ordinary shell output, so such output is retained like shell output. Lines removed by shrinking the window are not added to history, history lines are not reflowed when the window width changes, and `clear` sequences that erase the scrollback (`ESC[3J`) clear it. Selection and `Copy` apply to the rows currently displayed; text that was never displayed cannot be copied in one operation. Shrinking the window while an alternate-screen application runs may clip the restored main screen.

Not supported: mouse reporting, 256-color/truecolor terminal types, italics/blink, window-title changes, multiple concurrent terminals, SSH agent/X11/port forwarding, and non-UTF-8 remote locales. This is a VT100-level terminal, not a universal terminal emulator; applications that require a richer terminal type may render incorrectly.

### Smoke test

Use an expendable file and a test server first.

1. Open `>_ SSH terminal`; confirm the prompt appears without asking for the SSH password again.
2. Run `vi /tmp/retro_selector_test.txt`, press `i`, type text, press Escape, type `:wq` and Enter. Check the file with `cat`.
3. Run `top`; check that it refreshes, then press `q`.
4. Resize the window and run `stty size`; it should match the window.
5. Run `sleep 100` and press Ctrl+C.
6. Run `seq 1 300`, scroll up with the wheel and scrollbar, run `echo done` while scrolled (typing returns to the bottom), then open and quit `vi` and check the earlier output is still there.
7. Click `Disconnect`; confirm the main window re-enables its controls and `Refresh` is needed again.

Live vi/top behavior on the author's device has not been verified.

## Automated tests

The suite in `tests/` uses only the standard `unittest` runner and the application's own dependencies; it never connects to a device and uses no ROMs, credentials or user data. Everything runs against a temporary directory with SSH/SCP/SFTP, dialogs and threads replaced by mocks, plus a real POSIX `sh` for the remote-listing filter.

| File | Covers |
| --- | --- |
| `tests/test_config.py` | Defaults, parsing, legacy `rom.source` fallback, invalid values, the example properties file, per-profile keys and extension filters (MAME, SNES, Mega Drive; saves and other systems rejected), placeholders, size/disk helpers and terminal helpers. |
| `tests/test_app.py` | Local loading and filtering per profile, covers, profile switching (marks, search and remote state isolated, visible fields), save/load round trips and compatibility with existing configurations, validation errors, copy/delete confirmations and refusals, listing events and batch results. |
| `tests/test_transfer.py` | Remote listing (SSH shell and SFTP), copy and deletion workers, partial failures and lost connections, shell quoting, symlink/directory rejection, host key checking and authentication options. |

Run from the repository root.

Windows CMD (the Tk GUI tests need a desktop session):

```cmd
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Linux (Tkinter, for example `python3-tk`, and a virtual display such as `xvfb`):

```bash
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
xvfb-run -a python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

Without a display, the Tk-based tests are reported as skipped (never as passed); `tests/test_config.py` tests that do not need Tk still run, but `tkinter` itself must be importable. Skipped tests mean the GUI behaviour was not checked.

Not covered by automated tests, and still pending manual verification: the real Tk window on Windows (layout, appearance, mouse use), real SSH/SCP/SFTP against an iPad 2 on iOS 6.1.3 (including the host key prompt and the interactive terminal), whether MD.emu, MAME4iOS or Snes9xEX accept the transferred files, ROM loading and play, sound and iCade input.

Local files generated by the application:

- `retro_selector.properties`
- `retro_selector_host_keys.json`

The repository-root `/roms/`, `/roms_mame/`, `/roms_snes/`, `/roms_md/`, `/samples_mame/` and `/samples/` folders are excluded from Git (`/samples/` remains as a protective rule for old local collections). Custom collection paths are not automatically added to `.gitignore`, and ignore rules do not remove files already tracked by Git.

## Troubleshooting

### Dependencies are missing

Install with the same interpreter used by the launcher:

```cmd
.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you do not use `.venv`, use `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.

When updating an existing installation, run the same command again to install the new `pyte` dependency (or `python -m pip install "pyte>=0.8.2"`).

### No local files appear

Check `Emulator` and, for MAME, `MAME content`, along with the matching source field. The directory must exist and contain files directly inside it with extensions supported by the active profile (`.zip` for MAME; see SNES above). Click `Load` after editing the active path. Switching modes intentionally clears previous files and marks.

### Remote operations require a valid local source

The current implementation uses shared configuration validation. `Refresh`, remote deletion, and `Save` also require the active local source directory to exist, even though they do not copy local files. Set an existing source directory for the selected mode before using them.

### Thumbnails are missing

Check that each optional PNG is readable, shares the ROM or sample filename stem, and is stored in the same directory. MAME sample ZIPs can be used without PNGs; the musical-note placeholder is expected for samples, and the emulator placeholder for ROMs without a cover.

### The remote panel is empty after switching modes

Switching modes invalidates the previous list and, when the connection settings are usable, reloads it automatically. If it stays empty, check `Remote ROMs` or `Remote samples` for the selected mode, then click `Refresh`. A missing or inaccessible remote directory produces an error; it is not created automatically.

### Authentication fails

Check the username, password, key file, passphrase, and server-side public-key authorization.

### SSH algorithm negotiation fails

Enable legacy RSA if the server requires `ssh-rsa`. Cipher or key-exchange errors require a separate compatibility adjustment; the checkbox does not enable those algorithms.

### Remote listing fails

Choose the mode supported by the server. `sftp` needs its subsystem; `ssh` needs a compatible POSIX shell. Also check that the active remote directory exists and is accessible.

### Copying or deletion fails

Check remote permissions and the result window. Copying requires SCP support. Deletion rejects symlinks and directories. Refresh the list before retrying uncertain outcomes.

## Limitations and assets

- Local and remote directories are not created automatically.
- Failed copies may leave partial remote files; there is no rollback.
- Each copy has a 10-minute timeout.
- Keep the application open until operations finish.
- ROM, BIOS, sample, and CHD dependencies and emulator compatibility are not resolved.
- No ROMs, samples, or artwork are distributed. Users are responsible for the appropriate rights.
- External assets and dependencies retain their respective licenses.
